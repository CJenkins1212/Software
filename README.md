This project takes five int variables and assigns them a value between 1 and 6. It then prints out each of the numbers plus the total added up.
This project might not be complicated but it was my first real use of ThreadLocalRandom, I was new to Java when I first made this so it actually helped quite a bit with understand Java's syntax.
This project takes no inputs, but outputs six variables, each of the five randomized variables and their total.
